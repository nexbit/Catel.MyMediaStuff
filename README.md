Catel.MyMediaStuff
==================

MyMediaStuff - Catel demo app (source code taken from http://mymediastuff.codeplex.com/)

The following intro was taken from the original CodePlex site.

Project Description
-------------------
MyMediaStuff is a demo application that shows some advanced features of Catel, an open-source MVVM Framework for WPF and Silverlight.

For more information about Catel, visit the [Catel official site] [1].

Below is a video demonstrating the application:

Although the application looks really simply (that's the purpose), there are some pretty advanced features that answer the following question:
* How to create view-models for user controls, based on the datacontext?
* How to play a video without directly calling an element on the view from the view-model?
* How to use services in the view-models to show pop-up windows?
