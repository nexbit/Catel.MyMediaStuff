MyMediaStuff readme
===================

MyMediaStuff is a demo application that shows some advanced features of Catel, an
open-source MVVM Framework for WPF and Silverlight.

For more information about Catel, visit http://catel.codeplex.com

Although the application looks really simply (that's the purpose), there are some
pretty advanced features that answer the following question:

1) How to create view-models for user controls, based on the datacontext?
2) How to play a video without directly calling an element on the view from the
   view-model?
3) How to use services in the view-models to show pop-up windows?
